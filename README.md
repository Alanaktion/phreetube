# phreetube

*A minimal YouTube alternative in PHP*

Phreetube is a lightweight PHP app that provides the core functionality of YouTube and other video sharing sites. It's basically just a video gallery with a database backend and a system for automating `libav` conversions. Maybe one day it'll have comments too.

The code is written using PSR standards and uses Composer for dependency management. It requires PHP 5.5+, MySQL, and libav, and will probably only run on linux. It likely needs lots of CPU and disk space too, depending on your implementation.
